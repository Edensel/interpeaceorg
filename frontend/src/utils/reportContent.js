                title: '1. Foreword from the Executive Director',
                body: `2025 has been a defining year for IPASUD Kenya. Against a backdrop of persistent drought, ongoing cross-border conflict, and the continuing displacement of thousands of families across the Ateker region, our teams have demonstrated extraordinary resilience and commitment in the pursuit of peace and sustainable development.\n\nThis report is first and foremost a tribute to the communities we serve — the women who walk for hours to reach a functioning borehole, the elders who sit in peace dialogues for days at a time, the teachers who hold lessons under acacia trees. Their courage drives everything we do.\n\nIn 2025, IPASUD Kenya reached over 1.2 million people across our five programme areas, facilitated 8 formal peace covenants between pastoral communities, and constructed 47 new water points in areas that had never before had piped access. We launched our first structured Climate Resilience programme and expanded our Lotikipi Refugee Settlement project to serve more than 18,000 displaced persons.\n\nWe remain deeply grateful to our donors, the Turkana County Government, our UN agency partners, and above all to our dedicated staff and community volunteers. Together, we are changing the story of this region — one community at a time.\n\nMr. Samuel Ekidor | Executive Director, IPASUD Kenya`,

                body: `The WASH programme remained IPASUD Kenya's largest intervention by budget and beneficiary reach in 2025. The programme operated across 30 communities in Turkana Central, South, and East sub-counties, with a focus on constructing durable water infrastructure, training community management committees, and integrating hygiene behaviour change communication.\n\nKey achievements in 2025:\n• 47 new boreholes drilled and motorised borehole pumps installed\n• 12 rehabilitated water points brought back into service\n• 34 community Water User Associations (WUAs) trained and registered\n• 62,000 people gained first-time access to safe drinking water within 1 km of home\n• Waterpoint fee collection systems established in 29 communities to ensure long-term maintenance\n• 180 trained hygiene promoters deployed across 6 sub-counties\n• WASH services integrated into 3 primary health care facilities\n\nChallenges: Extended drought conditions in Q2 and Q3 led to lower-than-expected groundwater yields in 6 locations, requiring deeper drilling and additional cost. Supply chain disruptions for borehole casing materials caused delays in 8 sites.\n\nResponse: IPASUD Kenya activated contingency agreements with two alternative suppliers and arranged emergency water trucking to affected communities during delays. A groundwater mapping exercise has been commissioned for 2026 to improve site selection accuracy.`,

                body: `This independent evaluation was commissioned by IPASUD Kenya and carried out by an independent evaluation team between September and November 2024. It assesses the WASH programme implemented across 30 communities in Turkana County between January 2022 and June 2024.\n\nOverall Rating: Satisfactory\n\nThe WASH programme has made significant and measurable contributions to improving access to safe water and sanitation in one of Kenya's most water-scarce counties. Across the 30 target communities, 450,000 people now have access to safe water within 1 km of their homes — compared to a baseline of 18% coverage. Open defecation rates fell from 74% to 31% in programme communities against a control group trajectory of 71%. Community Water User Associations are functional in 28 of 30 communities, and fee collection is covering operational maintenance costs in 24 of them.\n\nAreas for improvement include strengthening menstrual hygiene management (MHM) components in schools, improving spare parts supply chains in remote areas, and deepening male engagement in hygiene behaviour change activities.`,

                title: '2. Background & Context',
                body: `Turkana County is Kenya's largest county by area and among the most chronically water-insecure. Annual rainfall averages 250mm, highly variable and concentrated in two short rainy seasons. Groundwater resources exist but are deep and unevenly distributed. The 2022–2024 "four consecutive failed rainy seasons" drought — the worst in 40 years — exacerbated existing vulnerabilities dramatically.\n\nAt baseline (January 2022), only 18% of households in programme communities had access to safe water within 1 km, compared to the national rural average of 57% and the Turkana County average of 29%. Open defecation was practised by 74% of households. Water-related diseases including cholera, typhoid, and diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 38% of all outpatient visits to local health facilities.\n\nIPASUD Kenya's WASH programme was designed in close consultation with the Turkana County Department of Environment, Water, and Natural Resources, with co-financing from UNICEF Kenya and the European Union's ECHO humanitarian fund. The programme targeted the 30 most underserved communities as identified through a joint county-level vulnerability mapping exercise conducted in late 2021.`,

                body: `The evaluation used a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative household surveys with qualitative key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and direct observation.\n\nQuantitative Methods:\n• Household survey administered to a stratified random sample of 760 households across all 30 programme communities and 6 control communities\n• Waterpoint functionality assessment using the FUNWATER standardised tool\n• Review of programme administrative data, MEAL reports, and financial records\n\nQualitative Methods:\n• 48 key informant interviews (programme staff, community leaders, government officials, partner agencies)\n• 18 focus group discussions (separated by gender and age group)\n• 30 direct waterpoint facility observations using a structured checklist\n• 6 community case studies with in-depth documentation\n\nData Quality Assurance:\n• All enumerators received 3-day training including data quality checks\n• 10% back-check of surveys completed\n• Data entered double-blind and discrepancies resolved by evaluation team lead\n\nLimitations: The prolonged drought during the evaluation period may have influenced some community responses regarding waterpoint functionality, as seasonal boreholes were non-functional at time of visit. Evaluators attempted to triangulate these cases with historical data from WUA records.`,

                title: '4. Findings — Relevance & Effectiveness',
                body: `RELEVANCE\n\nThe WASH programme is highly relevant to the needs of Turkana County communities. The focus on borehole drilling and motorised pumping systems is appropriate for the hydrogeological context. The inclusion of community-led hygiene promotion aligns with county government priorities and the Kenya Sanitation and Water for All commitments.\n\nRelevance to most marginalised groups scored slightly lower — the evaluation found that nomadic pastoralist households, who represent approximately 30% of the population in programme communities, were less well-served by fixed infrastructure. Recommendations address this (see Section 12).\n\nEFFECTIVENESS\n\n• 93% of constructed waterpoints were functional at time of evaluation (28/30 communities)\n• Average walk time to water reduced from 4.2 hours to 0.7 hours\n• 88% of WUAs able to cover routine maintenance costs from fee collection\n• 91% of hygiene promoters still active in their communities 12 months after training\n• Cholera cases in programme communities: 0 reported in 2023 and 2024 (vs. 47 cases in the preceding 2-year period)\n• Self-reported handwashing with soap before meals: 61% (vs. baseline 22%)\n• Latrine coverage: 69% of households (vs. baseline 26% and control group 29%)`,

Supply chain disruptions in Q2 2023 caused a 14-week average delay across 8 construction sites, adding approximately 8% to construction costs. IPASUD Kenya's response — emergency supplier agreements — mitigated further cost escalation.\n\nIMPACT\n\nThe evaluation used a difference-in-differences (DiD) methodology to estimate programme-attributable impact:\n• Programme communities show 42 percentage point higher safe water access than control communities (adjusted for baseline)\n• Women and girls report saving an average of 3.5 hours per day previously spent on water collection — time now reported as being redirected to income generation and education\n• School attendance among girls increased by 19% in programme communities with school WASH facilities\n• Household income: No statistically significant difference vs. control communities, though qualitative evidence suggests the time savings have contributed to increased petty trade\n\nSUSTAINABILITY\n\n28 of 30 WUAs are registered legal entities with bank accounts and elected leadership. Average WUA reserve fund balance: KES 84,000, sufficient for 6 months of pump maintenance. Risk: 4 communities expressed concern about spare parts availability. IPASUD Kenya has since established a county-level spare parts depot to address this.`,

                title: '6. Cross-Cutting Issues & Conclusions',
                body: `GENDER\n\nThe programme made deliberate efforts to mainstream gender: WUA bylaws require a minimum of 50% women in leadership positions. At time of evaluation, 54% of WUA chair positions are held by women — exceeding the target. Hygiene promotion messages were developed in the Turkana language by women's groups.\n\nMenstrual Hygiene Management (MHM): This remains the weakest area. Only 4 of 22 schools in programme communities have dedicated girls' latrine facilities with menstrual hygiene materials. The evaluation recommends this be treated as a priority in the next programme phase.\n\nPROTECTION\n\nThe evaluation found no evidence of protection incidents associated with programme activities. Waterpoint management committees have been trained on protection referral pathways. Two cases of alleged financial mismanagement in WUAs were identified and successfully resolved through community mediation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIPASUD Kenya's WASH programme has delivered strong results across relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability dimensions. It has materially improved the lives of approximately 450,000 people in some of Kenya's most water-insecure communities. The programme stands as a model for community-managed rural water supply in arid and semi-arid contexts.`,

Develop a mobile/semi-mobile WASH service delivery model to reach nomadic pastoralist populations currently underserved by fixed infrastructure.\n2. Prioritise MHM-compliant facilities in all remaining school construction projects, with dedicated budget line.\n3. Establish a county agreement with the Ministry of Water to formally hand over large infrastructure to county government asset registers.\n\nMedium Priority:\n4. Expand the county spare parts depot into a franchised Community Enterprise model to ensure long-term commercial sustainability.\n5. Introduce digital payment systems (M-Pesa) for WUA fee collection to improve financial transparency and reduce elite capture risk.\n6. Deepen engagement with men and boys in hygiene promotion, including dedicated male hygiene champion roles.\n\nLow Priority (Longer Term):\n7. Commission a hydrogeological study to map safe groundwater sites across the remaining 40+ unserved communities in Turkana County.\n8. Explore solar-powered pumping as an alternative to diesel generators to reduce operational costs and emission.\n\nIPASUD Kenya Management Response: The management team has accepted all 8 recommendations and committed to incorporating them into the next programme phase design.`,

                body: `Turkana County has experienced recurring inter-communal conflict for generations, rooted in competition for scarce resources — water, pasture, and livestock — across the Kenya-Uganda-South Sudan-Ethiopia border triangle. Cattle raiding, armed attacks, and retaliatory violence have claimed thousands of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people since the 1980s.\n\nConflict has profound consequences for education. During major conflict flare-ups, schools close for weeks or months. Teachers relocate. Families displace. Children who experience violence as "normal" enter adulthood with limited peaceful conflict resolution skills, perpetuating cycles of violence.\n\nYet research — including IPASUD Kenya's own 2021 baseline study — shows that attitudes toward violence are most malleable in school-age years. Structured peace education, delivered by trained teachers in a safe school environment, can demonstrably shift norms around conflict, tolerance, and dialogue.\n\nIPASUD Kenya's Peace Education Programme was designed in response to these findings, co-developed with the Turkana County Education Office, the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC), and peace studies academics.`,

The curriculum covers: understanding conflict and its causes; peaceful conflict resolution skills; the value of cultural diversity; rights and responsibilities; Kenya's legal and constitutional peace frameworks. All materials are bilingual — English and Turkana — and use participatory, play-based, and storytelling methodologies.\n\nPillar 2 — Teacher Capacity Building\nAll participating schools receive intensive 5-day residential training for all class teachers, covering conflict-sensitive pedagogy, trauma-informed approaches, and curriculum delivery skills. Refresher training is provided annually. A teacher resource pack and digital resource library were developed in partnership with Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD).\n\nPillar 3 — School Peace Clubs and Community Linkage\nEach school establishes a peace club with elected student leadership. Clubs meet weekly, lead school peace events, and progressively engage parents and community leaders through peace dialogue forums. The most successful clubs have grown into community-level structures engaging adults outside the school setting.`,

Outcome measures included:\n• Standardised violence incident logs (submitted by head teachers monthly)\n• The Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale adapted for school violence contexts\n• The Handling Conflict Scale (HCS) — validated by the University of Nairobi — measuring 7 dimensions of conflict resolution attitudes\n• Focus group discussions with students, teachers, and parents\n• Key informant interviews with head teachers, sub-county education officers, and community elders\n\nSCHOOL-LEVEL OUTCOMES\n\nViolence Incidents: Programme schools recorded 34% fewer violence incidents per 100 students than control schools in the same period (p<0.01). The reduction was largest for physical fights between students from different communities (52% reduction) and smallest for property theft (8% reduction).\n\nConflict Resolution Attitudes: 78% of students completing the curriculum scored in the "prosocial" range on the HCS at endline, compared to 34% at baseline and 41% in control schools at endline.\n\nSchool Retention: Dropout rates were 22% lower in programme schools. Head teachers consistently link this to improved school safety and the sense of belonging generated by peace clubs.`,

                body: `COMMUNITY-LEVEL OUTCOMES\n\nIn 6 of 22 programme schools, parent-teacher associations and peace clubs jointly formed community peace committees — extending the programme's reach beyond school gates. These committees have:\n• Mediated 12 formal disputes between community members\n• Established early-warning information networks (WhatsApp groups) with village elders\n• Organised 4 inter-community peace walks\n\nCASE STUDY — LAKITATANA PRIMARY SCHOOL\n\nLakitatana Primary serves the Kalapata and Nakurio communities — historically in conflict over a shared grazing boundary. In 2023, students from both communities who had completed the peace curriculum proposed a joint tree-planting project on the disputed boundary as a "peace gesture." What began as a school project grew into a formal boundary agreement signed by 14 elders from both communities in October 2023 — the first such agreement in 20 years. The county government has since used Lakitatana as a model for its own community boundary mediation programme.\n\nGENDER & INCLUSION ANALYSIS\n\nGirls comprise 48% of peace club members — close to population parity and significantly higher than typical extra-curricular participation rates. 6 of the 22 school peace clubs are led by girls. The curriculum explicitly challenges gender norms that validate male violence, and focus groups with teachers suggest this has opened important conversations at the household level. Boys from nomadic families remain underrepresented (14% of club members vs. 22% of school population) due to seasonal migration.`,

                body: `CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe evidence robustly supports the conclusion that IPASUD Kenya's Peace Education Programme is generating meaningful, measurable, and durable change in the attitudes and behaviours of conflict-affected children and their communities in Turkana County. The 3-pillar design — integrating curriculum, teacher capacity, and community linkage — produces synergistic effects that none of the pillars would achieve alone.\n\nKey lessons:\n1. Community ownership is non-negotiable. Schools where the head teacher and parent community were most engaged produced the strongest outcomes.\n2. Language matters profoundly. Turkana-language materials dramatically increased engagement compared to English-only materials piloted earlier.\n3. The community ripple effect is the most powerful (and most underestimated) element — when students bring peace education home, families and communities transform.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Expand the programme to 15 additional schools in 2025, prioritising secondary schools given their role in shaping adolescent identity.\n2. Develop an adult peace education curriculum to formally extend the approach to community peace committees.\n3. Partner with Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to formally accredit the curriculum, paving the way for eventual national adoption.\n4. Establish a 2-year follow-up study tracking students who completed the curriculum into their community and family lives.\n5. Train community peace committee members in basic mediation and negotiation skills to increase the quality of community-level dispute resolution.\n6. Strengthen data collection on the gender dimensions of curriculum impact, particularly regarding boys' attitudes toward women and girls.`,

It represents the most comprehensive peace agreement reached in the Lotikipi Basin in over three decades.\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE CONFLICT\n\nThe Lotikipi Basin is a vast semi-arid plain straddling Kenya, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. It is home to three predominantly pastoralist communities — the Turkana (Kenya), the Toposa (South Sudan), and the Nyangatom (Ethiopia) — whose traditional grazing territories overlap significantly.\n\nIn the pre-colonial era, these communities maintained complex but functional systems for managing shared resources. Colonial-era international border demarcation disrupted these arrangements, and successive post-independence governance failures left the communities to manage cross-border tensions with minimal state support.\n\nThe period 2018–2025 saw an escalation in violence, driven by: the proliferation of small arms from South Sudan's civil conflict; three consecutive years of drought reducing available pasture; and youth unemployment creating a generation with few economic alternatives to raiding. Conservative estimates suggest 340 conflict-related deaths and 8,200 livestock lost to raiding between 2020 and 2025 in the Lotikipi area alone.`,

Crucially, a moratorium on raiding was quietly agreed between Turkana and Toposa elders in April 2024 — holding for 6 continuous months, the longest such moratorium in recent memory.\n\nPhase 2 — Joint Dialogue (July–November 2024):\nFive joint dialogue sessions convened at a neutral venue in Lokichoggio, Kenya. Attended by 18 elders from each community and 6 women leaders from each side. Key points of agreement emerged on: shared water point governance, cattle movement notification protocols, and a joint grazing calendar.\n\nPhase 3 — Covenant Drafting (December 2025–January 2026):\nA drafting committee of 3 elders per community, supported by legal advisers from IPASUD Kenya and the South Sudan Peace Commission, produced the covenant text through 4 intensive 3-day sessions. The final text was reviewed and approved by the full community assemblies of all three communities before signing.`,

It was commissioned by IPASUD Kenya to inform strategic programme planning and to contribute to evidence-based peacebuilding advocacy.\n\nKey Findings:\n• The conflict system in the Ateker region is deeply interconnected across borders — interventions that do not address cross-border dynamics are unlikely to achieve durable peace\n• Climate change has emerged as the single most significant accelerating factor in conflict frequency and severity since 2018, with drought events directly correlating with conflict escalation\n• Small arms proliferation from South Sudan's civil conflict has fundamentally altered the lethality of historically non-lethal cattle raiding traditions\n• Women bear a disproportionate burden of conflict consequences but are systematically excluded from peace processes\n• Youth unemployment and the collapse of traditional livelihoods are creating a generation with strong incentives for conflict engagement and limited alternatives\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Ateker region encompasses approximately 200,000 km² across four countries and is home to an estimated 3.5 million people, primarily from the interrelated Ateker ethnolinguistic family (Turkana, Karamojong, Toposa, Nyangatom, Jie, Dodos). The region's communities share deep cultural, linguistic, and historical bonds, yet are divided by international borders that were drawn without their participation and that separate them from traditional governance systems, trade routes, and seasonal migration patterns.`,

                body: `HISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nPre-colonial period: Ateker communities managed inter-communal relations through complex traditional systems including age-set governance, inter-marriage alliances, and regulated raiding ceremonies that were culturally bounded and rarely lethal.\n\nColonial period (1890s–1960s): British and Italian colonial demarcation of international borders in Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan disrupted traditional resource-sharing arrangements. Colonial administrations simultaneously disarmed communities (creating security vacuums) and introduced commodity economies that monetised previously non-monetary community relations.\n\nPost-independence (1963–2000): The four states' limited governance presence in these remote border areas created effective governance vacuums. Conflict over resources, particularly water and livestock, intensified with population growth and reductions in available pasture.\n\n2000–2020: South Sudan's civil wars (1983–2005; 2013–2018) flooded the region with automatic weapons and military-trained combatants, transforming traditional herder violence into much more lethal armed conflict. Droughts in 2009, 2011, and 2017 produced significant conflict spikes.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThis analysis draws on: review of 240 published and grey literature sources; ACLED conflict incident data 2010–2025; original key informant interviews with 86 community leaders, government officials, NGO staff, and researchers; 12 focus group discussions; and IPASUD Kenya's own Early Warning Monitoring Unit data from 2021–2025.`,

Drivers: shared water points (Lochwa, Natira, Lopii), seasonal cattle migration routes, accumulated grievances from 2019 Toposa raid that killed 28 Turkana.\n\nKaramoja-Turkana Border (Kenya-Uganda): Secondary flashpoint. 180 deaths 2020–2025. Primary axis: Turkana-Karamojong. Ugandan military KDLG intervention has partially reduced violence on Uganda side, but cross-border incidents persist.\n\nDaasanach-Nyangatom Border (Kenya-Ethiopia): Moderate intensity. 120 deaths 2020–2025. Water scarcity at Lake Turkana's southern shore is key driver as lake levels fluctuate.\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS\n\nStructural Causes (deep-rooted, slow-changing):\n1. Colonial border demarcation fragmenting traditional governance\n2. State absence and weak rule of law in border areas\n3. Chronic poverty and limited economic alternatives\n4. Patriarchal and militarised cultural norms around masculinity\n\nProximate Causes (more immediate drivers):\n1. Climate-induced resource scarcity — drought reducing water and pasture\n2. Small arms availability and declining cost of lethal violence\n3. Specific triggering incidents (raids, deaths, livestock theft)\n4. Political instrumentalisation of conflict by elected officials at election times\n\nConnectors (factors working against conflict):\n1. Traditional governance systems (elders, age-sets)\n2. Women's networks and cross-community trading relationships\n3. Inter-community marriage alliances\n4. Shared religious practices and sacred sites`,

Economic motivation (cattle as wealth) combined with cultural expectations around masculinity and bravery.\n• Armed militia: In the Kenya-South Sudan corridor, former South Sudanese military elements operate as commercial raiders for hire.\n• Political elites: Evidence suggests some politicians fund raiding parties during election periods to mobilise ethnic constituencies.\n\nPeace Actors:\n• Elders councils: The primary legitimate governance structure. Their authority is declining but remains significant.\n• Women's groups: Often most motivated and consistent peace actors. Frequently excluded from formal processes.\n• Religious leaders: Church networks in Turkana and faith leaders in Karamoja have mediated local ceasefires.\n• NGO sector: IPASUD Kenya, Interpeace, Mercy Corps, NRC among active peacebuilding practitioners.\n• Government: Kenya's National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) and the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) have relevant mandates but limited field presence.\n\nCLIMATE-CONFLICT NEXUS\n\nStatistical analysis of ACLED conflict incident data against CHIRPS rainfall data 2010–2025 shows a strong inverse correlation (r = -0.74) between annual rainfall anomaly and conflict incident frequency. The 2022–2024 four-season drought produced a 62% increase in conflict incidents compared to the preceding 3 wet years.\n\nMechanisms:\n• Reduced water availability → competition for shared water points → trigger incidents\n• Reduced pasture → cattle migration into contested areas → contact with opposing herders\n• Livestock productivity loss → economic pressure to raid to rebuild herds\n• Food insecurity → male youth leave farming, enter raiding economy\n\nGENDER DIMENSIONS\n\nWomen disproportionately bear conflict consequences: widowhood, displacement, food insecurity, GBV (particularly in displacement settings). Yet 94% of formal peace meeting participants across the Ateker region are male. Women-led peace networks operate informally and largely invisibly to international actors — but are often more operational and trusted than formal elder councils. This analysis strongly recommends deliberate gender mainstreaming in all peacebuilding programming.`,

                body: `YOUTH AND CONFLICT\n\nYouth (15–35) are both the primary perpetrators and primary victims of conflict in the Ateker region. Demographic analysis shows the region's youth population has grown by 34% in 10 years while formal employment has grown by less than 8%. Traditional pastoralist livelihoods are increasingly unviable due to climate change and land degradation.\n\nQualitative evidence from focus groups suggests youth are not inherently committed to conflict — many express deep desire for peaceful, economically viable lives. However, raiding remains one of the few high-return economic activities available in remote border areas. Creating meaningful alternatives through vocational training, scholarships, and business support is therefore a central element of any sustainable peace strategy.\n\nEXISTING PEACE ARCHITECTURE\n\nForths at national level: Kenya's NCIC, the Regional Centre on Small Arms (RECSA), Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) mechanisms. These are largely inaccessible to community-level actors.\n\nAt sub-regional level: The Cross-Border Peace Initiative (CBPI), co-led by IPASUD Kenya, brings together civil society from all four countries for annual dialogue. The Lotikipi Peace Covenant (2026) is the most recent and significant product of this architecture.\n\nAt community level: Elder councils, age-set governance, women's peace networks. These are the most immediate but often the least resourced elements of the architecture.\n\nCONFLICT TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nWithout intervention, the combination of climate change, demographic pressure, and arms availability points to escalating conflict frequency and lethality over the next decade. However, the analysis identifies genuine "windows of opportunity" — including the Lotikipi Covenant momentum, growing government commitment in all four countries to border security, and a generation of educated youth who want alternatives to conflict — which make transformative peacebuilding possible.\n\nKey recommendations: (1) Cross-border governance infrastructure for shared resource management; (2) Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration with real livelihoods offers; (3) Climate adaptation investment designed explicitly to reduce resource competition; (4) Formal inclusion of women in all peace processes with binding minimum quotas; (5) Youth economic opportunity programming at scale.`,
