        content: `IPASUD Kenya (Inter-Peace Agency for Sustainable Development) today launched its most ambitious water, sanitation, and hygiene initiative to date, with funding from the European Union delegation to Kenya.

The programme, running from 2026 to 2028, will construct 45 boreholes, rehabilitate 12 water points, and establish community water management committees across Turkana South sub-county. Access to safe and clean drinking water remains one of the most pressing humanitarian challenges in the region — a challenge made worse by prolonged droughts and inter-communal conflicts over water points.

Executive Director noted: "Access to clean water is not just a development issue — it is a peace issue. Water scarcity has historically been one of the primary drivers of conflict among pastoral communities in the region."

The initiative will also include hygiene promotion campaigns, school sanitation facilities in 20 primary schools, and capacity building for local WASH committees. Community members, including women and youth, will be trained as Water Quality Champions to ensure long-term sustainability.

Working alongside county health officials and local administration, IPASUD Kenya aims to reduce waterborne disease prevalence by 40% within the first two years of the programme. Monitoring and evaluation teams will conduct quarterly field assessments to track progress and adapt approaches based on community feedback.

This WASH initiative forms part of IPASUD Kenya's broader strategy to address the root causes of conflict in Turkana — where access to water, pasture, and land continues to be a flashpoint for inter-communal tensions.`

        content: `A landmark peace agreement was signed in Lotikipi, Turkana County, bringing an end to years of violent cattle raiding and resource-based conflicts among three pastoral communities — the Turkana, Toposa (South Sudan), and Nyangatom (Ethiopia) peoples.

The agreement, brokered by IPASUD Kenya with support from the county government and UNDP, establishes shared grazing zones, conflict early-warning mechanisms, and a joint community security committee comprising elders from all three communities.

The six-month mediation process involved 14 structured dialogue sessions, 3 cross-border elder summits, and extensive community consultations involving women's groups and youth leaders. Over 200 community representatives participated directly in the peace process.

"This agreement is not just a piece of paper — it is a commitment between our communities to choose dialogue over violence," said a senior elder from the Turkana community. "We have suffered enough. Our children deserve to grow up knowing peace."

The peace covenant includes provisions for the peaceful movement of livestock across traditional routes, a mechanism for reporting and resolving disputes before they escalate, and a joint plan for sharing and managing water points during drought periods.

IPASUD Kenya will continue to support implementation through monthly peace committee meetings, conflict monitoring, and community peace education campaigns. The team will also facilitate quarterly reviews of the agreement to ensure all parties remain committed to its terms.

This milestone builds on IPASUD Kenya's track record of facilitating more than 20 peace agreements across the Ateker region since 2015, making it one of the most active peacebuilding organisations in the border triangle area of Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia.`

        content: `Over 2,500 children who had been out of school due to conflict and displacement are now attending learning centres established by IPASUD Kenya under its Peace Education Programme, funded by UNICEF and the Norwegian Refugee Council.

The children, aged between 6 and 16 years, had been denied access to formal education due to insecurity, displacement from their home communities, and a lack of nearby schools. Many had not attended school for one to three years — a gap that risks permanently affecting their futures.

IPASUD Kenya established 15 Emergency Learning Centres (ELCs) across Turkana South, Turkana Central, and the Karamoja border areas of Uganda. Each centre includes trained teachers, temporary classrooms, learning materials, and a school feeding programme providing at least one nutritious meal per day.

Critically, the programme integrates peace education into the standard curriculum. Children learn conflict resolution, cultural tolerance, and cooperative problem-solving — skills that help them become ambassadors of peace within their families and communities.

"When children go to school, communities become more stable," explained the Education Programme Manager. "Education is one of the most powerful tools for breaking the cycle of conflict and poverty."

Girls make up 48% of enrolled children — a significant achievement in a region where girls' education has historically been deprioritised due to early marriage and cultural norms. The programme provides girls with separate sanitation facilities, feminine hygiene products, and targeted mentoring to improve retention.

Moving forward, IPASUD Kenya plans to transition the most successful ELCs into permanent community schools, working with the Ministry of Education and county government to ensure government teachers and national resources are progressively deployed to these locations.`

        content: `IPASUD Kenya has been formally accepted into the UN-Habitat Global Coalition for Sustainable Pastoral Communities, joining 47 organisations from 28 countries working on pastoralism, land rights, and conflict resolution.

The membership was confirmed at a ceremony in Nairobi, attended by UN-Habitat representatives, county government officials, and international NGO partners. The coalition serves as a global platform for sharing knowledge, evidence, and advocacy strategies around pastoral livelihoods and peace.

As a member, IPASUD Kenya will contribute field-level evidence from its work in the Ateker region, participate in global policy dialogues, and benefit from access to technical expertise, funding networks, and peer learning from partner organisations across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

"This recognition reflects the quality and impact of our work in Turkana and the greater Ateker region," said the Executive Director. "We are proud to represent our communities at the global level and to bring international best practices back to our programmes."

IPASUD Kenya will lead a working group on cross-border pastoralism and conflict resolution — leveraging its unique experience working across the Kenya-Uganda-South Sudan-Ethiopia border triangle, where pastoral communities regularly cross national boundaries in search of water and pasture.

The coalition partnership opens doors to new funding opportunities, including a dedicated UN-Habitat grant window for member organisations working on climate-resilient pastoral communities. IPASUD Kenya has already submitted a concept note for a three-year regional pastoral resilience programme.`

        content: `IPASUD Kenya mobilised rapid emergency response to address severe food insecurity affecting pastoral communities in Turkana, Marsabit, and Samburu counties, following one of the worst droughts in recent memory across the Horn of Africa.

Over 8,000 families — approximately 48,000 individuals — received emergency food packages containing maize flour, beans, cooking oil, and fortified blended foods. In addition, livestock owners received emergency feed supplements and veterinary support to help preserve the animals that represent their primary livelihood and source of nutrition.

The response was funded through a combination of emergency grants from the Kenya Red Cross, the World Food Programme (WFP), and private donors. IPASUD Kenya's existing community networks and field presence allowed distributions to begin within 72 hours of emergency declaration — faster than most external responders.

"During a drought like this, every day matters," said the Emergency Response Coordinator. "Our teams already know these communities, they know the terrain, and they know how to reach the most vulnerable families — including those in remote areas that other organisations cannot easily access."

Beyond immediate food relief, the response included nutrition screening for children under five, with 340 cases of acute malnutrition identified and referred to health facilities for therapeutic feeding. Lactating mothers also received specialised nutrition supplements.

Looking ahead, IPASUD Kenya's food security programme will work with affected communities on drought-resilient livelihood strategies, including drought-tolerant crop cultivation, water harvesting techniques, and savings and credit group formation — building long-term resilience against future shocks.`

IPASUD Kenya's WASH programme attacks this problem at the root.\n\nWe design, drill, and rehabilitate boreholes and water pans in the most remote and underserved communities. But we don't just hand over infrastructure and leave — we train elected community WASH committees (at least 50% women) who oversee maintenance, collect user fees, and hold contractors accountable. Communities own their water systems, and that sense of ownership is what makes them last.\n\nSince our founding, we have constructed and rehabilitated over 180 water facilities serving more than 450,000 people in Turkana County alone.

IPASUD Kenya's Peace Education programme is built on a simple but radical idea: if you want peace in the next generation, you have to educate for it in this one.\n\nWe operate 15 emergency learning centres (ELCs) in conflict-affected villages where children have been cut off from formal education. These are not just temporary facilities — they are vibrant hubs of learning, play, and trauma recovery. Our curricula blend the Kenya national curriculum with conflict resolution, emotional regulation, and dialogue skills developed specifically for the Ateker context.\n\nBeyond the classrooms, we train teachers as peace agents. Our teacher training programme has equipped over 200 educators with skills to recognise signs of trauma, facilitate difficult conversations between children of rival communities, and model the values of dialogue and non-violence. We prioritise girls' education — providing scholarships, sanitary products, and mentoring to keep adolescent girls in school beyond primary level.",
